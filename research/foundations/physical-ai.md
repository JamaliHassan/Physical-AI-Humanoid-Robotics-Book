# Physical AI Concepts Research

## Overview
Physical AI refers to the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems, particularly in the context of robotics. It encompasses the development of intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world.

## Key Concepts

### Embodied Intelligence
- Intelligence that emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment
- The body is not just a vessel but an integral part of the cognitive process
- Learning through physical interaction and sensorimotor experiences

### Perception-Action Loop
- Continuous cycle of sensing, processing, and acting
- Real-time feedback mechanisms
- Adaptive behavior based on environmental changes

### Physical Reasoning
- Understanding of physics, spatial relationships, and object properties
- Predictive modeling of physical interactions
- Planning and execution of physical tasks
