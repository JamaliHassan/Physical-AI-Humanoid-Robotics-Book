- Collection of tools and packages for robotics simulation
- Integration with ROS via ROS# or Unity ROS TCP Connector
- Sample environments and robot models

### ML-Agents
- Machine learning framework for Unity
- Training of robotic agents in simulation
- Reinforcement learning and imitation learning capabilities

### Physics Simulation
- PhysX physics engine for realistic interactions
- Collision detection and response
- Joint and constraint systems

### Sensor Simulation
- Camera sensors with realistic rendering
- LIDAR simulation (through plugins)
- IMU and other sensor simulation

## Integration Approaches

### ROS Integration
- Unity ROS TCP Connector for communication
- Message serialization and deserialization
- Real-time data exchange between Unity and ROS

### Robot Model Import
- Converting URDF to Unity models
- Maintaining kinematic structure
- Joint mapping and control

## Use Cases
- High-fidelity visualization
- Training environments for AI
- Human-robot interaction simulation
- Advanced graphics rendering
