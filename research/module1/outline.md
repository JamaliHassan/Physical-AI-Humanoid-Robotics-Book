# Module 1: Introduction to ROS 2 - Outline

## Module Overview
This module introduces students to ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the foundational framework for robotics development. Students will learn core concepts, communication patterns, and development tools.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- Create and run basic ROS 2 nodes in Python and C++
- Implement different communication patterns (topics, services, actions)
- Work with robot descriptions using URDF
- Use ROS 2 tools for debugging and visualization

## Module Structure

### Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals
- What is ROS 2 and why use it?
- ROS 2 vs ROS 1: Key differences
- Installation and workspace setup
- Basic terminology: nodes, packages, workspaces

### Chapter 2: Nodes and Communication
- Creating ROS 2 nodes
- Publisher/subscriber pattern with topics
- Client/server pattern with services
- Action servers and clients

### Chapter 3: Launch Files and Parameters
- Organizing nodes with launch files
- Parameter management
- Working with YAML configuration files

### Chapter 4: URDF and Robot Modeling
- Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Creating simple robot models
- Visualizing robots in RViz

### Chapter 5: Tools and Best Practices
- Essential ROS 2 tools (ros2 CLI, RViz, rqt)
- Debugging techniques
- Package structure and organization

## Hands-on Labs
- Create a publisher and subscriber
- Implement a service client and server
- Build a simple robot model with URDF
- Launch multiple nodes with launch files

## Assessment
- Quiz on ROS 2 concepts
- Practical exercise: Create a simple ROS 2 package with communication nodes
