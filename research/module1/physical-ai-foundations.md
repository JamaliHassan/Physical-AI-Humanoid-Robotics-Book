# Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence Research

## Overview
Physical AI refers to the development of artificial intelligence systems that interact with and operate in the physical world. Embodied intelligence is a key component, emphasizing that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment.

## Core Concepts

### Embodied Cognition
- The mind is not separate from the body
- Cognitive processes are shaped by physical interactions
- Intelligence emerges from sensorimotor experiences

### Embodied Intelligence
- Intelligence that requires a physical form
- Learning through physical interaction
- Adaptation to environmental constraints

### Physical Reasoning
- Understanding of physics and spatial relationships
- Predictive modeling of physical interactions
- Planning based on physical constraints

## Key Research Areas

### Perception-Action Loops
- Continuous cycle of sensing, processing, and acting
- Real-time feedback mechanisms
- Adaptive behavior based on environmental changes

### Morphological Computation
- Using body properties for computation
- Passive dynamics for control
- Material properties for sensing

### Developmental Robotics
- Lifelong learning in robots
- Human-like development of capabilities
- Social learning and interaction

## Applications in Humanoid Robotics

### Sensorimotor Learning
- Learning from physical interaction
- Motor skill development
- Adaptive control strategies

### Social Interaction
- Human-robot interaction through physical presence
- Embodied communication
