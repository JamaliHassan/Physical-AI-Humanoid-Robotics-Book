# Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on integrating AI perception and decision-making capabilities into your humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac tools.

## Overview

In this module, you'll learn to implement AI-powered perception systems, navigation, and control for humanoid robots. We'll use NVIDIA's Isaac ecosystem to create sophisticated AI capabilities optimized for robotics applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up Isaac Sim for AI training and simulation
- Configure Isaac ROS perception packages
- Implement Visual SLAM for localization and mapping
- Set up navigation systems for humanoid robots

## Module Structure

This module consists of several chapters that build upon each other:

- **M3C1: Isaac Sim Setup** - Learn to configure Isaac Sim for humanoid robotics
- **M3C2: Isaac ROS & VSLAM** - Implement visual perception and SLAM systems
- **M3C3: Nav2 for Humanoids** - Configure navigation for bipedal movement

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed Modules 1 and 2
- NVIDIA RTX GPU with compatible drivers
- Isaac Sim 4.0+ installed
- ROS 2 Humble/Iron

## Next Steps

Begin with Chapter 1: [Isaac Sim Setup](./m3c1-isaac-sim-setup).
