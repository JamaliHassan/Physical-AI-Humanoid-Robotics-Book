# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on creating integrated Vision-Language-Action systems that enable natural human-robot interaction.

## Overview

In this module, you'll learn to implement complete AI systems that can perceive the environment, understand natural language commands, and execute appropriate actions. This represents the culmination of all previous modules in a unified VLA pipeline.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Integrate vision, language, and action systems
- Implement voice command processing with OpenAI integration
- Create multimodal perception for object recognition
- Deploy complete VLA pipeline on humanoid robot
- Execute the "Clean Up Task" capstone project

## Module Structure

This module consists of several chapters that build upon each other:

- **M4C1: Voice-to-Action** - Implement natural language to robot action mapping
- **M4C2: VLA Pipeline** - Create integrated vision-language-action system

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed Modules 1, 2, and 3
- Understanding of all previous concepts
- OpenAI API access for language processing
- Complete robot simulation environment

## Next Steps

Begin with Chapter 1: [Voice-to-Action](./m4c1-voice-to-action).
