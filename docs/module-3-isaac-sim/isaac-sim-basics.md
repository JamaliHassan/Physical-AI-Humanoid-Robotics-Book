# Isaac Sim Basics

## Overview

This chapter introduces Isaac Sim, NVIDIA's high-fidelity simulation application built on the Omniverse platform, providing GPU-accelerated physics simulation and realistic rendering for robotics applications. Isaac Sim offers advanced capabilities for robotics simulation with RTX ray tracing and PhysX physics engine.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Install and configure Isaac Sim using Docker
- Understand USD (Universal Scene Description) basics
- Create simple simulation scenes in Isaac Sim
- Import and configure robot models in Isaac Sim

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of simulation concepts from Module 2
- Experience with ROS 2 from Module 1

## Chapter Outline

This chapter covers:
1. Isaac Sim installation and Docker setup
2. USD basics and scene composition
3. Robot model import and configuration
4. Physics and rendering settings
5. ROS 2 integration in Isaac Sim

## Hands-on Activities
