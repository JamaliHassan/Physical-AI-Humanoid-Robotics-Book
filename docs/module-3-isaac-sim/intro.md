# Introduction to Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Ecosystem

## Overview

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. In this module, we'll explore NVIDIA's Isaac ecosystem, including Isaac Sim for high-fidelity simulation and Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated perception. You'll learn to leverage GPU acceleration for advanced robotics applications and integrate sophisticated perception and navigation systems.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you will:
- Set up and configure Isaac Sim for robotics simulation
- Implement GPU-accelerated perception using Isaac ROS packages
- Configure and tune the Navigation2 (Nav2) system
- Optimize robotic applications using GPU acceleration
- Create complete robotic systems integrating simulation, perception, and navigation

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Modules 1 and 2 (ROS 2 and simulation fundamentals)
- Understanding of basic computer vision concepts
- Familiarity with GPU computing concepts (helpful but not required)
- Basic knowledge of navigation and path planning concepts

## Module Structure

This module is divided into several chapters that build upon each other:

1. **Isaac Sim Introduction** - Installation and basic concepts
2. **Advanced Isaac Sim** - Physics and sensor simulation
3. **Isaac ROS Packages** - Hardware-accelerated perception
4. **Navigation with Nav2** - Path planning and obstacle avoidance

Let's begin exploring the powerful NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem!
