# Introduction to Module 2: Digital Twin - Gazebo and Unity

## Overview

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. In this module, we'll explore simulation environments that serve as digital twins for physical robots. You'll learn to create realistic simulation environments using Gazebo Garden and Unity, enabling safe testing and validation of robotic systems before real-world deployment.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you will:
- Create realistic simulation environments with Gazebo Garden
- Develop high-fidelity visualizations using Unity
- Integrate simulation environments with ROS 2 systems
- Model physics accurately for realistic robot behavior
- Simulate various sensors for testing perception systems

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of URDF robot modeling
- Familiarity with robot sensors and their functions
- Understanding of basic physics concepts (helpful but not required)

## Module Structure

This module is divided into several chapters that build upon each other:

1. **Gazebo Fundamentals** - Core concepts and setup
2. **Advanced Gazebo Simulation** - Physics and sensor modeling
3. **Unity for Robotics** - High-fidelity visualization and simulation
4. **Digital Twin Implementation** - Connecting simulation to reality

Let's begin exploring the world of robotics simulation!
