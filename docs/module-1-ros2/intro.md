# Introduction to Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. In this module, we'll explore the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the foundational framework for robotics development.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you will:
- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- Create and run basic ROS 2 nodes in Python
- Implement different communication patterns (topics, services, actions)
- Work with robot descriptions using URDF
- Use ROS 2 tools for debugging and visualization

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic programming knowledge in Python
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

## Module Structure

This module is divided into several chapters that build upon each other:

1. **ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Core concepts and workspace setup
2. **Nodes and Communication** - Publisher/subscriber and service patterns
3. **Launch Files and Parameters** - Organizing and configuring ROS 2 applications
4. **URDF and Robot Modeling** - Describing robots in XML format
5. **Tools and Best Practices** - Essential tools and development workflows

Let's begin our journey into ROS 2!
