# URDF Basics

## Overview

This chapter introduces the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF), which is used to describe robot models in ROS 2. URDF is essential for defining robot structure, kinematics, and visualization properties that are used in simulation and real-world applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Create basic robot models using URDF
- Define links and joints for robot structures
- Visualize robot models in RViz
- Understand the relationship between URDF and robot simulation

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts

## Chapter Outline

This chapter covers:
1. URDF structure: links, joints, and materials
2. Defining physical properties (mass, inertia, visual, collision)
3. Creating kinematic chains for robotic arms and mobile bases
4. Using Xacro for parameterized and modular robot descriptions
5. Visualizing and debugging URDF models

## Hands-on Activities

- Create a simple wheeled robot model
- Build a robotic arm with multiple joints
- Use Xacro to create a parameterized robot model
- Visualize your robot in RViz
