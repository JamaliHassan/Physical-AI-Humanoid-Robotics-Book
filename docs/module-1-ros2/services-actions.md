# Services and Actions

## Overview

This chapter covers services and actions in ROS 2, which provide request-response communication patterns for robotics applications. Services offer synchronous communication for simple requests, while actions provide asynchronous communication with feedback for long-running tasks.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Implement service-based communication in ROS 2
- Create and use actions for complex tasks with feedback
- Understand when to use services vs actions vs topics
- Handle synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of nodes and topics from Chapter 2

## Chapter Outline

This chapter covers:
1. Service implementation (request-response pattern)
2. Action servers and clients (goal-feedback-result pattern)
3. When to use services vs actions vs topics
4. Error handling and recovery in service and action calls
5. Practical examples of services and actions in robotics

## Hands-on Activities

- Create a service server for mathematical calculations
- Implement an action client for robot navigation
- Compare performance between different communication patterns
