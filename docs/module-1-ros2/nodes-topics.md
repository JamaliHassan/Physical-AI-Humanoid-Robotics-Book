# Nodes and Topics

## Overview

In this chapter, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of nodes and topics in ROS 2, which form the basis of the publisher-subscriber communication pattern. This asynchronous, decoupled communication method is essential for building distributed robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Create ROS 2 nodes using Python
- Implement publisher-subscriber communication
- Understand message passing in ROS 2
- Use built-in message types and create custom messages

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts from Chapter 1

## Chapter Outline

This chapter covers:
1. Node creation and lifecycle management
2. Publisher and subscriber implementation
3. Built-in message types and custom message definitions
4. Quality of Service (QoS) profiles for reliable communication
5. Practical examples of topic-based communication in robotics

## Hands-on Activities

- Create a simple publisher and subscriber pair
- Implement a temperature monitoring system
- Experiment with different QoS settings
