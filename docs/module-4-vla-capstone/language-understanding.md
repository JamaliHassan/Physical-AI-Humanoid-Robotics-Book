# Language Understanding and LLM Integration

## Overview

This chapter explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) for natural language understanding in robotics applications, enabling robots to interpret and respond to human commands.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Integrate LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, or local) with robotic systems
- Design effective prompts for robotic task interpretation
- Extract intent and entities from natural language commands
- Implement context-aware language processing

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of voice processing concepts
- Experience with API integration

## Chapter Outline

This chapter covers:
1. Integration with Large Language Models
2. Prompt engineering for robotics applications
3. Intent recognition and entity extraction
4. Context-aware language processing
5. Safety and validation of interpreted commands

## Hands-on Activities

- Integrate LLM API with ROS 2 system
- Design and test prompts for robotic commands
- Implement intent and entity extraction
- Create safety validation for interpreted commands
