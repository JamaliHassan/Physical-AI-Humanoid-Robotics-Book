# Action Planning and Execution

## Overview

This chapter covers the mapping of natural language commands to specific robot actions, including task decomposition and execution monitoring for voice-controlled robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Map natural language to specific robot actions
- Decompose complex commands into action sequences
- Integrate with existing robot control systems
- Monitor action execution and provide feedback

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of language processing concepts
- Experience with robot control systems

## Chapter Outline

This chapter covers:
1. Mapping language concepts to robot actions
2. Task decomposition and planning algorithms
3. Integration with existing robot skill libraries
4. Action execution monitoring and feedback
5. Error handling and recovery strategies

## Hands-on Activities

- Create action mapping system for robot commands
- Implement task decomposition algorithms
- Integrate with robot skill libraries
- Test action execution with monitoring
