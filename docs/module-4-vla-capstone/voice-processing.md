# Voice Processing and Speech Recognition

## Overview

This chapter introduces the voice processing component of VLA systems, focusing on converting speech to text using advanced models like Whisper and integrating with ROS 2 systems. Voice processing is the first step in creating natural human-robot interaction through spoken commands.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Implement speech recognition using Whisper
- Process audio input for robotic applications
- Integrate voice processing with ROS 2 systems
- Handle real-time voice streaming and buffering

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of ROS 2 concepts from Module 1
- Basic knowledge of audio processing concepts

## Chapter Outline

This chapter covers:
1. Speech recognition fundamentals and Whisper architecture
2. Audio preprocessing and noise reduction
3. Real-time voice processing considerations
4. Integration with ROS 2 audio systems
5. Voice activity detection and streaming

## Hands-on Activities

- Set up Whisper for speech recognition
- Create a ROS 2 node for audio input handling
- Implement voice activity detection
- Test speech recognition with various audio inputs
