# Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on creating digital twins of your humanoid robots using simulation environments.

## Overview

In this module, you'll learn to create realistic simulation environments that mirror the physical world. Digital twins are essential for testing, training, and validating humanoid robot behaviors before deployment on physical hardware.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up Gazebo Fortress for humanoid robotics simulation
- Create gym environments for robot training
- Configure realistic sensor models with noise parameters
- Understand the simulation-to-reality transfer

## Module Structure

This module consists of several chapters that build upon each other:

- **M2C1: Gazebo Basics & Digital Twin Concepts** - Learn to create humanoid training environments
- **M2C2: Unity Bridge** - Advanced visualization for Human-Robot Interaction

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- NVIDIA RTX GPU for Isaac Sim (recommended)
- Gazebo Fortress installed

## Next Steps

Begin with Chapter 1: [Gazebo Basics & Digital Twin Concepts](./m2c1-gazebo-fortress).
