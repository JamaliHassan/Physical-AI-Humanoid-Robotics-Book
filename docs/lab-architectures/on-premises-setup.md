# On-Premises Lab Architecture

## Overview

This chapter details the canonical on-premises lab setup for Physical AI and humanoid robotics development, including hardware specifications and infrastructure requirements.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Design an on-premises lab architecture for robotics development
- Specify hardware requirements for different components of the Physical AI stack
- Plan networking and infrastructure for robotics labs
- Understand the trade-offs in on-premises vs cloud solutions

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of the Physical AI concepts from previous modules
- Basic knowledge of networking and infrastructure concepts

## Chapter Outline

This chapter covers:
1. Canonical "on-prem lab" specification (RTX workstation + Jetson + sensors + robot)
2. Hardware component specifications and selection criteria
3. Networking and infrastructure planning
4. Safety and operational considerations
5. Cost analysis and budget planning

## Hands-on Activities

- Design a lab architecture for a specific use case
- Calculate hardware requirements for your scenario
- Plan the infrastructure layout
