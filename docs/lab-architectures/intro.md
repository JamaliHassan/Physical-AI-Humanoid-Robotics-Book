# Introduction to Lab Architectures

## Overview

This section covers the hardware and software architectures needed for implementing Physical AI and humanoid robotics systems. We'll explore both on-premises lab setups and cloud-based solutions to support the development and deployment of the systems covered in this book.

## What You'll Learn

In this section, you will:
- Understand the canonical on-premises lab architecture for robotics development
- Explore cloud-based solutions for robotics simulation and computation
- Learn about hardware requirements for different components of the Physical AI stack
- Review networking and infrastructure considerations for robotics labs

## Section Structure

This section is organized into several topics:

1. **On-Premises Lab Architecture** - Hardware and infrastructure for local development
2. **Cloud Robotics Solutions** - Leveraging cloud resources for computation and simulation
3. **Hardware Components** - Detailed breakdown of required robotics hardware
4. **Networking and Infrastructure** - Setting up the supporting infrastructure

Let's begin exploring the architectures that enable Physical AI and humanoid robotics!
