# Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals - Prerequisites and Dependencies

## Required Prior Knowledge

### Programming Fundamentals
- **Python Programming**: Basic to intermediate knowledge of Python including:
  - Variables, data types, and control structures
  - Functions and object-oriented programming concepts
  - Exception handling
  - File handling and basic I/O operations
  - Understanding of modules and packages

### Software Development Concepts
- **Command Line Interface**: Comfortable with terminal/shell operations:
  - Navigating file systems (cd, ls, pwd)
  - File manipulation (cp, mv, rm, mkdir)
  - Environment variables and PATH configuration
  - Basic text editing from command line (nano, vim, or similar)

### Computer Science Fundamentals
- **Basic Data Structures**: Understanding of:
  - Arrays/lists, dictionaries/maps
  - Basic algorithms and problem-solving approaches
  - Time and space complexity concepts (basic understanding)

### Software Engineering Practices
- **Version Control**: Basic knowledge of Git:
  - Clone, commit, push, pull operations
  - Branching and merging concepts
  - Understanding of repository structure

## Beneficial Prior Knowledge

### Mathematics
- **Basic Linear Algebra**: Understanding of:
  - Vectors and basic vector operations
  - Coordinate systems and transformations
  - (Helpful for robotics applications but not required)

### Robotics Concepts
- **Fundamental Robotics**: Basic understanding of:
  - What a robot is and its components
  - Basic concepts of sensors and actuators
  - Simple control systems
  - (Will be explained during the module but helpful if known)

### Software Architecture
- **Distributed Systems**: Basic concepts of:
  - Message passing between components
  - Client-server architecture
  - Network communication concepts
  - (Helpful but not required as ROS 2 concepts will be taught)

## Learning Curve Expectations

### For Students with Programming Background
- Expected to spend 2-3 hours getting familiar with ROS 2 specific concepts
- Focus on learning ROS 2 communication patterns and tools
- Can move faster through basic Python examples

### For Students with Robotics Background
- May need additional time for programming aspects
- Can leverage understanding of robotics concepts
- Will benefit from understanding the ROS 2 architecture

### For Students with Both Backgrounds
- Expected to progress at the standard pace
- Can serve as peer mentors in mixed-skill study groups

## Resources for Prerequisite Knowledge

### Python Programming
- Python.org tutorial for beginners
- Codecademy Python course
- "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes

### Command Line Interface
- "The Command Line Crash Course" by Shaw
- Linux Command Line tutorial
- Terminal usage in the context of development environments

### Git and Version Control

- "Pro Git" book online

## Assessment of Prerequisites

### Self-Assessment Checklist
Before starting Module 1, students should be able to:
- [ ] Write a simple Python program with functions and classes
- [ ] Navigate directories and manipulate files using command line
- [ ] Explain what variables, loops, and functions are
- [ ] Perform basic Git operations (clone, commit, push)

### Remedial Path
Students who find gaps in prerequisites should:
1. Complete relevant sections in prerequisite resources
2. Practice with simple examples before Module 1
3. Seek help during office hours if needed
4. Consider peer study groups with complementary skills

## Support During Module 1
- Additional Python examples for students needing programming review
- Command-line reference sheets
- Glossary of technical terms
- Recommended tutorials for specific gaps
