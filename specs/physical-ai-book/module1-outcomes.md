# Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals - Key Points and Learning Outcomes

## Module Overview
Module 1 introduces students to ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the foundational framework for robotics development. Students will learn core concepts, communication patterns, and development tools necessary for building robotic applications.

## Key Points

### Core ROS 2 Architecture
- Node-based distributed computing model
- Communication patterns: topics (pub/sub), services (req/resp), actions (goal/feedback/result)
- Parameter management and configuration
- Launch files for orchestrating complex systems

### Development Environment
- ROS 2 workspace creation and management
- Package structure and organization
- Build tools (colcon) and dependency management (rosdep)
- Command-line tools for debugging and introspection

### Robot Modeling
- URDF for describing robot structure
- Links, joints, and materials in robot descriptions
- Integration with simulation environments
- Visualization tools (RViz)

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Module 1, students will be able to:

### Knowledge Outcomes
1. Explain the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 architecture and its advantages over ROS 1
2. Describe the different communication patterns in ROS 2 and when to use each
3. Understand the structure and purpose of URDF in robot modeling
4. Identify the key tools in the ROS 2 ecosystem and their functions

### Skills Outcomes
1. Create and build ROS 2 packages using proper workspace structure
2. Implement nodes with different communication patterns (topics, services, actions)
3. Create launch files to orchestrate multi-node systems
4. Build basic robot models using URDF
5. Use ROS 2 tools (ros2 CLI, RViz, rqt) for debugging and visualization
6. Configure parameters and manage node configurations

### Application Outcomes
1. Design a simple robotic system using appropriate ROS 2 communication patterns
2. Integrate multiple nodes into a cohesive robotic application
3. Create robot models suitable for simulation and real-world deployment
4. Troubleshoot common issues in ROS 2 applications

## Prerequisites
Students should have:
- Basic programming knowledge in Python
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

## Assessment Criteria
Students will demonstrate mastery by:
- Successfully creating a ROS 2 package with multiple communication patterns
- Building a URDF model and visualizing it in RViz
- Creating launch files that properly coordinate multiple nodes
- Explaining the appropriate use of different communication patterns
- Demonstrating proficiency with ROS 2 debugging tools

## Connection to Other Modules
- Module 2 (Simulation): URDF knowledge used for robot simulation
- Module 3 (Isaac): ROS 2 communication patterns essential for Isaac ROS integration
- Module 4 (VLA): Node architecture supports voice-language-action integration

## Duration
This module is designed to be completed in 3 weeks with 6-8 hours of study per week.
